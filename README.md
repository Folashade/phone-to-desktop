## FYI 
+ The sold button works now !!! 
+ there need to be at least one listing for the app to start
+ Ex data.txt (if errors):
	- [{"desc":"get","author":"vrom","date":"2013-11-01T21:13:27.119Z","price":5,"sold":false}]
	- The view (static/index.html) requires the js file (eebae.js) that sets up what happens on post, and calls the first get()
	- then app.js handles the backend calls to the database
	- so... static/ = frontend
	- __all the files not in that folder are backend__


### Resources
+ [Node](node.js)

### Questions
+ How to start...? 
  - npm install
	- node app

### Problems
+ None known atm


### Notes 
+ get request that calls app request
+ compute the answer
+ return query and slice math
